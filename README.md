##Setup Installation Requirements
* Ubuntu studio
* Visual Studio Code
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* Jquery 
Because this stuff is important.*HTML and CSS, Javascript and Jquery* are an essential part** of your learning curve.

 First need to install Node.js—head over to http://www.nodejs.org in order to download the package for your chosen platform.
  Nodejs to help you check if your JS script is running.

Fire up a Node Command Prompt and then change to your project folder.
Enter this command: npm install jquery.
Node will fetch and install jQuery—it displays a confirmation message when the installation is complete.

Create a HTML file, JS file and CSS file. We will edit these files using Visual Studio code.
Ensure that a Bootstrap, JS file, CSS file and the Jquery file is link to your html.

HTML, short for *HyperText Markup Language*, consists of these things called tags, which are words written between.
** For the HTML file use a form from bootstrap. Ensure your Bootstrap.css is linked to your HtML file through <link href="">
Create divs,rows,columns and input as desired.

The Style.css file will be used to edit our website and make it visually appealing.

** For my Js file, I wrote a function that will be able to submit my form and give a pop up alert that the user's message has been received.

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
One of the ways I used jQuery is to introduce the toggle method to display information on Delani studio when the image is clicked upon. 
The jQuery library contains the following features:

-HTML/DOM manipulation
-CSS manipulation
-HTML event methods
-Effects and animations
-AJAX
-Utilities

Mail Chimp Api is used to send user message and is directly linked to the host's email address.
